# Wallpp

This folder contains the frontend, backend and what was supposed to be a mobile app in Typescript, but I grew tired of the project
and wanted to do something else :-)

## My experience üó£

The frontend was made with NextJS, I really liked it, but I learned that using authetication and storing the JWT 
token on cookies was a bad choice. I ran into several problems with SSR and Cookies, but ultimately was a good experiency.

The backend was made with AdonisJS, it grew on me, I love it. Some stuff that could be better are getting revamped in Adonis v5. ‚ù§
